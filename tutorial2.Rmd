## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
hh_vars_2018 <- pums_variables %>%
  distinct(year, survey, var_code, 
           var_label, data_type, level) %>%
  filter(level == "housing", year == 2018, survey == "acs1")
```
```{r}
person_vars_2018 <- pums_variables %>%
  distinct(year, survey, var_code, 
           var_label, data_type, level) %>%
  filter(level == "person", year == 2018, survey == "acs1")
```
```{r}
area_vars_2018 <- load_variables(2018, "acs1")

```
```{r}
area_vars_2010 <- load_variables(2010, "sf1")

```

```{r load person-level data, results = 'hide'}
person_data <- get_pums(variables = c("TEN", 
                                      "SEX", 
                                      "PINCP", 
                                      "WKHP", 
                                      "JWMNP"),
                        state = "TX", 
                        year = 2018, 
                        survey = "acs1",
                        recode = TRUE) %>%
  filter(JWMNP > 0) %>%
  select(TEN_label, SEX_label, PINCP, WKHP, JWMNP)
